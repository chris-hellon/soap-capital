        Risk Warning
    </MudText>

    <MudText Class="mb-5">
        Trading foreign exchange, indices and commodities, on margin, carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all individuals. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in crypto, foreign exchange or other markets you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some, or all, of your initial investment. Therefore, you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. In some cases, it is possible to lose more than your initial investment as it is not always possible to exit a market at the price you intend upon doing so. There are also risks associated with utilising an Internet-based trade execution software application including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware and software. You should be aware of all the risks associated with investing in foreign exchange, indices and commodities and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. The information made available by Soap Captial is for your general information and use and is not intended to address your requirements. In particular, the information does not constitute any form of advice or recommendation and is not intended to be relied upon by users in making, or refraining from making, any investment decisions. Soap Captial, will not accept liability for any loss or damage, including but without limitation to, any financial loss, which may arise directly or indirectly from use of or reliance on such information either provided by them or others that participate in the services provided.

        Disclosure Statement
    </MudText>

    <MudText Class="mb-5">
        The risk of loss in trading Crypto, Foreign Exchange (FOREX), indices and commodities can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in the light of your financial condition. In considering whether to trade or to authorise someone else to trade for you, you should be aware of the following:

    </MudText>
    <MudText Class="mb-5">
        If you purchase a commodity option, you may sustain a total loss of the premium and all of the transaction cost. If you purchase or sell a commodity future or sell a commodity option, you may sustain a total loss of the initial margin funds and any additional funds that you deposit with your broker to establish or maintain your position. If the market moves against your position, you may be called upon by your broker to deposit a substantial amount of additional margin funds, on short notice, in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the required funds within the prescribed time, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for any resulting deficit in your account.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Class="mb-5">
        Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when the market makes a ‘limit move’.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Class="mb-5">
        The placement of contingent orders by you or your trading advisor, such as a “stop-loss” or “stop-limit” order, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amount, since the market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Class="mb-5">
        The high degree of leverage that is obtainable through, for example, futures trading, options trading, Spread Betting, Binary Betting and CFD trading can work against you as well as for you. The use of leverage can lead to large losses as well as gains. This brief statement can’t disclose all the risks and other significant aspects of the commodity markets, including trading shares, currencies, and stock indices. You should therefore carefully study financial trading before you enter the financial markets with the view of buying and selling, including shorting, securities in the marketplace.

        Soap Captial may discuss some of the strategies they use to trade the markets. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. No guarantee is being made that any individual will be able to replicate hypothetical performance results. There are certain factors that can cause a sharp difference between the price that is read off the chart and the price that is actually achieved when a trader attempts to enter or exit a position. Such factors include but are not limited to, the effect of slippage on stop orders or the failure of an individual’s broker to fill them at a requested price.

    </MudText>
    <MudText Class="mb-5">
        One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.
