    <MudText Class="mb-5">
        Subscriptions that are paid for are non-refundable. If a subscriber was to cancel their subscription, they are authorised to use soap.capital services until the end of their subscribed month. Thus, any subscriptions paid for in full are non-refundable regardless the timing of the subscription cycle within that business month.
    </MudText>

    <MudText Class="mb-5">
        In the case of an error in the subscription process after a payment has been processed, that particular payment for that month will be refunded pending an investigation into the reason for the error. Further to this if there were any technical issues with the subscription that has been paid for in full, this will have to be reported using the contact link and in turn this will be investigated with a refund or similar outcome which will be decided by soap.capital pending the outcome.
